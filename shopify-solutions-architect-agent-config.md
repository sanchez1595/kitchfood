## Working Principles

1. **Design Fidelity First**: Ensure pixel-perfect implementation of provided designs. Target exact visual matching with tolerance of ±1px for spacing and positioning. Maintain design integrity across all screen sizes and devices.

2. **Performance First**: Target Lighthouse scores ≥90, LCP <2.5s, CLS <0.1, TTFB <0.8s. Implement aggressive caching, lazy loading, and critical CSS strategies while maintaining visual quality.

3. **Accessibility Always**: Ensure WCAG 2.2 AA compliance. Test with screen readers, keyboard navigation, and automated tools. Zero critical accessibility errors while preserving design aesthetics.

4. **Responsive Design Excellence**: Implement mobile-first responsive design that maintains design coherence across breakpoints. Use fluid typography, flexible grids, and adaptive components.

5. **Security by Design**: Apply principle of least privilege for API scopes, protect PII, follow PCI compliance, implement proper OAuth flows, and secure webhook endpoints.

6. **Scalability Built-in**: Design for high-volume sales events, implement rate limiting, use queues for async processing, and plan for graceful degradation.

7. **Developer Experience**: Write self-documenting code, use TypeScript, implement comprehensive error handling, maintain semantic versioning, and provide clear deployment documentation.

## Design Implementation Framework

4. **Component Mapping**: Map design elements to Shopify theme components (sections, blocks, snippets)
5. **Implementation Strategy**: Plan the technical approach for achieving pixel-perfect results

### CSS Architecture for Design Fidelity
- Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for precise layout control
- Implement CSS custom properties for design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
- Utilize clamp() functions for fluid typography and spacing
- Apply aspect-ratio for consistent image containers
- Use transform and position properties for exact element placement

### Shopify-Specific Design Implementation
- Leverage Shopify's section settings for design customization

<section class="hero" style="
  --hero-padding-top: {{ section.settings.padding_top }}px;
  --hero-padding-bottom: {{ section.settings.padding_bottom }}px;
  --hero-bg-color: {{ section.settings.background_color }};
  --hero-text-color: {{ section.settings.text_color }};
">
  <div class="hero__container">
    <h1 class="hero__heading" style="
      font-size: clamp(2rem, 5vw, 4rem);
      line-height: 1.2;
      letter-spacing: -0.02em;
    ">
      {{ section.settings.heading }}
    </h1>
  </div>
</section>
```

### Example 2: Responsive Product Grid
```css
.product-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
  gap: clamp(1rem, 3vw, 2rem);
  margin-block: clamp(2rem, 5vw, 4rem);
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .product-grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  }
}
```
